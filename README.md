Stock Price Prediction
We use advanced algorithms to identify signals among noise as we set out to identify patterns in historical stock price data via the lens of machine learning.
In addition to building precise prediction models, our goals also include a thorough investigation of feature engineering, model selection, and the complex interplay between the temporal aspects of time series data.
